Step 7: Ethical Reflection (Personalized Version)

Working on this project made me realize how much the quality and diversity of data can influence the fairness of a machine learning model.
Because my dataset is based on crop production data from India, it reflects patterns and conditions that may not apply to farmers in other regions. This means the model could perform well for certain states or large-scale farms, but not necessarily for smaller or marginalized communities with different environmental challenges.

I also recognized that data bias isn’t just a technical issue — it’s a social one. If most of the data represents high-yield or well-funded farms, the model’s predictions might unintentionally favor those groups, leaving out smallholder farmers who actually need this kind of support the most.

From a sustainability perspective, the project has strong potential for good. Predictive yield modeling can help farmers make informed decisions about when and how much to plant, optimize fertilizer and water use, and reduce waste — all of which contribute to SDG 2: Zero Hunger. However, it’s important that such technologies remain accessible and affordable, so they benefit everyone, not just those with advanced resources.

Overall, this project has shown me that building ethical and fair AI isn’t just about coding — it’s about understanding the people behind the data and ensuring that the solutions we create promote equity, sustainability, and long-term impact.Title: Predicting Crop Yield using Machine Learning (SDG 2: Zero Hunger)

Problem:
Agricultural productivity varies due to weather, soil, and crop factors. We aim to predict crop yields using machine learning to support data-driven decisions in sustainable farming.

ML Approach:
Supervised learning using Linear Regression to predict crop yield based on features like crop type, season, area, and year.

Dataset:
Crop Production Dataset from Kaggle (India), containing records of crop production, area, and season from multiple districts.

Results:
The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of ~0.75, showing reasonable accuracy in predicting yields. Visualization of actual vs. predicted yields showed a strong positive correlation.

Ethical Considerations:
Regional bias in the dataset may limit global generalization. Ensuring smallholder farmers benefit from predictive agriculture tools is essential. This solution supports sustainable agriculture by improving resource planning and reducing waste.
