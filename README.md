Title: Predicting Crop Yield using Machine Learning (SDG 2: Zero Hunger)

Problem:
Agricultural productivity varies due to weather, soil, and crop factors. We aim to predict crop yields using machine learning to support data-driven decisions in sustainable farming.

ML Approach:
Supervised learning using Linear Regression to predict crop yield based on features like crop type, season, area, and year.

Dataset:
Crop Production Dataset from Kaggle (India), containing records of crop production, area, and season from multiple districts.

Results:
The Linear Regression model achieved an RÂ² score of ~0.75, showing reasonable accuracy in predicting yields. Visualization of actual vs. predicted yields showed a strong positive correlation.

Ethical Considerations:
Regional bias in the dataset may limit global generalization. Ensuring smallholder farmers benefit from predictive agriculture tools is essential. This solution supports sustainable agriculture by improving resource planning and reducing waste.
